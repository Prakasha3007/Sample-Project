= Task Execution and Scheduling

In the absence of an javadoc:java.util.concurrent.Executor[] bean in the context, Spring Boot auto-configures an javadoc:org.springframework.core.task.AsyncTaskExecutor[].
When virtual threads are enabled (using Java 21+ and configprop:spring.threads.virtual.enabled[] set to `true`) this will be a javadoc:org.springframework.core.task.SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor[] that uses virtual threads.
Otherwise, it will be a javadoc:org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor[] with sensible defaults.

If a custom `Executor` bean is present, you can request Spring Boot to auto-configure an `AsyncTaskExecutor` anyway, as follows:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  task:
    execution:
      mode: force
----

The auto-configured executor will be automatically used for:

- Asynchronous task execution (`@EnableAsync`), unless an javadoc:org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.AsyncConfigurer[] bean is present.
- Spring for GraphQL's asynchronous handling of javadoc:java.util.concurrent.Callable[] return values from controller methods.
- Spring MVC's asynchronous request processing.
- Spring WebFlux's blocking execution support.

[TIP]
====
If you have defined a custom javadoc:java.util.concurrent.Executor[] in the context, both regular task execution (that is javadoc:org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableAsync[format=annotation]) and Spring for GraphQL will use it.
However, the Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux support will only use it if it is an javadoc:org.springframework.core.task.AsyncTaskExecutor[] implementation named `applicationTaskExecutor`.

Depending on your target arrangement, you could set configprop:spring.task.execution.mode[] to `force` to auto-configure an `applicationTaskExecutor`, change your javadoc:java.util.concurrent.Executor[] into an javadoc:org.springframework.core.task.AsyncTaskExecutor[] or define both an javadoc:org.springframework.core.task.AsyncTaskExecutor[] and an javadoc:org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.AsyncConfigurer[] wrapping your custom javadoc:java.util.concurrent.Executor[].

Another option is to define those beans explicitly.
The auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.boot.task.ThreadPoolTaskExecutorBuilder[] or javadoc:org.springframework.boot.task.SimpleAsyncTaskExecutorBuilder[] allow you to easily create instances that reproduce what the auto-configuration does by default.
====

[NOTE]
====
If multiple javadoc:java.util.concurrent.Executor[] beans are defined with configprop:spring.task.execution.mode[] to `force`, all the supported integrations look for a bean named `applicationTaskExecutor`.
If the auto-configured `AsyncTaskExecutor` is not defined, only regular task execution fallbacks to a bean named `taskExecutor` to match Spring Framework's behavior.
====


When a javadoc:org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor[] is auto-configured, the thread pool uses 8 core threads that can grow and shrink according to the load.
Those default settings can be fine-tuned using the `spring.task.execution` namespace, as shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  task:
    execution:
      pool:
        max-size: 16
        queue-capacity: 100
        keep-alive: "10s"
----

This changes the thread pool to use a bounded queue so that when the queue is full (100 tasks), the thread pool increases to maximum 16 threads.
Shrinking of the pool is more aggressive as threads are reclaimed when they are idle for 10 seconds (rather than 60 seconds by default).

A scheduler can also be auto-configured if it needs to be associated with scheduled task execution (using javadoc:org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableScheduling[format=annotation] for instance).

If virtual threads are enabled (using Java 21+ and configprop:spring.threads.virtual.enabled[] set to `true`) this will be a javadoc:org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.SimpleAsyncTaskScheduler[] that uses virtual threads.
This javadoc:org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.SimpleAsyncTaskScheduler[] will ignore any pooling related properties.

If virtual threads are not enabled, it will be a javadoc:org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskScheduler[] with sensible defaults.
The javadoc:org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskScheduler[] uses one thread by default and its settings can be fine-tuned using the `spring.task.scheduling` namespace, as shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  task:
    scheduling:
      thread-name-prefix: "scheduling-"
      pool:
        size: 2
----

A javadoc:org.springframework.boot.task.ThreadPoolTaskExecutorBuilder[] bean, a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.task.SimpleAsyncTaskExecutorBuilder[] bean, a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.task.ThreadPoolTaskSchedulerBuilder[] bean and a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.task.SimpleAsyncTaskSchedulerBuilder[] are made available in the context if a custom executor or scheduler needs to be created.
The javadoc:org.springframework.boot.task.SimpleAsyncTaskExecutorBuilder[] and javadoc:org.springframework.boot.task.SimpleAsyncTaskSchedulerBuilder[] beans are auto-configured to use virtual threads if they are enabled (using Java 21+ and configprop:spring.threads.virtual.enabled[] set to `true`).

===== Using ApplicationTaskExecutorBuilder
Spring Boot provides a standardized approach to accessing the application task executor across different Spring integrations.
The `ApplicationTaskExecutorBuilder` class provides a consistent API for different component types:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
private ApplicationTaskExecutorBuilder executorBuilder;

// Get a basic Executor - suitable for GraphQL
Executor executor = executorBuilder.getExecutor();

// Get an AsyncTaskExecutor - suitable for MVC, WebFlux, WebSocket
AsyncTaskExecutor asyncExecutor = executorBuilder.getAsyncTaskExecutor();

// Get a TaskExecutor - suitable for JPA and other integrations
TaskExecutor taskExecutor = executorBuilder.getTaskExecutor();
----

This consistent approach avoids type mismatch issues when different Spring integrations require different
executor types, while still using the same underlying `applicationTaskExecutor` bean.

All Spring Boot auto-configurations that require task execution now use this builder approach.
